# Fake News Classification using Deep Learning and Classical Algorithms

# About
Fake news refers to misinformation or disinformation presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity or making money through advertising revenue. However, identifying the veracity of an article can be a complex task due to the quality of writing, inherent biases, or simply the nature of the information being reported.

In this project, we aim to tackle the problem of fake news detection using machine learning and deep learning approaches. We employ a diverse set of models including classical machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and advanced Deep Learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).
